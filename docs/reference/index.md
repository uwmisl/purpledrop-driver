# Internal API Reference

This section contains documentation generated from the purpledrop-driver
internal python code. Most users will be more interested in the 
[HTTP API](/api) or other documentation, but you may find this useful if you
are modifying or calling into the python code. This documentation remains
rather incomplete for now, and you may find you need to go straight to the
code.
